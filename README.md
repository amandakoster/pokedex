# PokeDex
Welcome to my first ever PokeDex! I spent ~ 6 hours on this project. Below you will find npm commands to run the code locally, a link to the deployed site on Heroku and a link to the repo on GitHub. 

### A simple single page site that will allow users to find and explore content from the Pokemon API, https://pokeapi.co/

### Delivery:
* A way to access the code for the project:
    - [npm start]
* Github repository (public) preferred though not required: 
    - https://github.com/amandakoster/blink-api
* URL to view a live version of the site:
    - https://amanda-pokedex.herokuapp.com/

### Process
* build generic scaffold: npm create-react-app
* create GH repo, push scaffold to GH repo
* organize scope: put scope into .md file and break out project into tasks
* pseudo code the tasks into the scaffolding
* create anticipated files for component that will build the app, pseudo code for each component
* read about how the API works
* Added search form
* search for 1 poke, show prop (abilities)
* Added 2nd API call for all poke (limit = ~20)
* Mapped through the data
* rendered poke on the page
* styled a bit
* deploy to firebase or gh pages: didn't work because node_modules are in .gitignore
* deployed to Heroku

### Bonus tasks:
* Make the interface responsive: DONE
* Flourishes or niceties in the design (e.g. animations for search results) : minor
* Detailed modal popup for an item
* A mind for accessibility: DONE (alt text, Contrast Ratio 16.26:1, appropriate html tags)
* Include a test plan and user tests: minor, there is a scaffolding for testing

### Using one of these APIs:
* implement the provided wireframe layout, 
* displaying the data from the API and
* allowing users to use the search bar to search or filter content.
* You can title your application
* select whatever background image you feel fits best for your application.
* This is your application, and design touches or flourishes are encouraged.

### With more time I would add the following: 

#### Functionality:
* refactor 2 API calls into 1 for speed.
* refactor App.js functionality into separate components. There is a lot of functionality in the App.js, not allowing for reusable components which is a benefit of React.js
* incorporate provided Pokeman API library, may have saved time.
* keep playing with this!

#### Features:
* list up 3 characteristics for each Pokemon 'card'
* add ways to filter these characteristics in the header
* upon searching a Pokemon, have an image of the Pokemon appear along with its abilities or other characteristics
* clickable, animated 'cards' that link to a detail page for each Pokemon
* modify the design to accommodate this additional data

### Guidelines:
* The background on the top section behind the title and search bar is meant to be an image.
* Each item should include a name, a link (external) to more information and any information you see fit
* The project should take about 4-6 hours
* Try not to go over 6 hours, this is more about seeing your process and code than about a finished product
* You will have the opportunity to walk us through your thought process
* You may use any frameworks or libraries you would like
* Should be compatible with the latest of each modern desktop browser
* Don&#39;t be afraid to ask us questions along the way

### Evaluation Criteria:
* Clean HTML, CSS and Javascript code
* Good use and understanding of your chosen libraries and frameworks
* Nice design
