# PokeDex
Welome to my first ever PokeDex! I spoek up to 6 hours on this project. Below you will find npm commands to run the code locally, a link to the deployed site on Heroku and a link to the repo on GitHub. Given more time I would add the following features:

* list 2-3 characteristics for each Pokemon 'card'
* ways to filter these characteristics 
* upon searching a POkemon, have an image of hte POkeman apepar along with it's abilits or other characterits
* clickable 'cards' that link to a detail page for each Pokemon
* modify the design to accomodate this additional data

## A simple single page site that will allow users to find and explore content. The data for the site should
come from one of the following API sources: Pokemon API

### Delivery:
* A way to access the code for the project:
    - [npm start](#npm-start)
* Github repository (private or public) preferred though not required: 
    - https://github.com/amandakoster/blink-api
* URL to view a live version of the site:
    - https://amanda-pokedex.herokuapp.com/

### Bonus tasks:
* Make the interface responsive: DONE
* Flourishes or niceties in the design (e.g. animations for search results) : minor
* Additional search or filtering features
* Detailed modal popup for an item
* A mind for accessibility: DONE (alt text, Contrast Ratio 16.26:1, appropriate html tags)
* Include a test plan and user tests: minor, there is a scaffolding for testing

### Using one of these APIs:
* implement the provided wireframe layout, 
* displaying the data from the API and
* allowing users to use the search bar to search or filter content.
* You can title your application
* select whatever background image you feel fits best for your application.
* This is your application, and design touches or flourishes are encouraged.

### Guidelines:
* The background on the top section behind the title and search bar is meant to be an image.
* Each item should include a name, a link (external) to more information and any information you see fit
* The project should take about 4-6 hours
* Try not to go over 6 hours, this is more about seeing your process and code than about a finished product
* You will have the opportunity to walk us through your thought process
* You may use any frameworks or libraries you would like
* Should be compatible with the latest of each modern desktop browser
* Don&#39;t be afraid to ask us questions along the way

### Evaluation Criteria:
* Clean HTML, CSS and Javascript code
* Good use and understanding of your chosen libraries and frameworks
* Nice design
