# Challenge:
Create a simple single page site that will allow users to find and explore content. The data for the site should
come from one of the following API sources (pick 1)

* Pokemon Monsters - https://pokeapi.co/

### Using one of these APIs:
* implement the provided wireframe layout, 
* displaying the data from the API and
* allowing users to use the search bar to search or filter content.
* You can title your application
* select whatever background image you feel fits best for your application.
* This is your application, and design touches or flourishes are encouraged.

### Guidelines:
* The background on the top section behind the title and search bar is meant to be an image.
* Each item should include a name, a link (external) to more information and any information you see fit
* The project should take about 4-6 hours
* Try not to go over 6 hours, this is more about seeing your process and code than about a finished product
* You will have the opportunity to walk us through your thought process
* You may use any frameworks or libraries you would like
* Should be compatible with the latest of each modern desktop browser
* Don&#39;t be afraid to ask us questions along the way

### Evaluation Criteria:
* Clean HTML, CSS and Javascript code
* Good use and understanding of your chosen libraries and frameworks
* Nice design
### Bonus tasks if you have extra time:
* Make the interface responsive
* Flourishes or niceties in the design (e.g. animations for search results)
* Additional search or filtering features
* Detailed modal popup for an item
* A mind for accessibility
* Include a test plan and user tests

### Delivery: Send to use the following items
* A way to access the code for the project
* Github repository (private or public) preferred though not required
* URL to view a live version of the site
